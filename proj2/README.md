# Project 2: Hamming Distance

Project Description: Hamming Distance
Write an assembly language program that prompts the user for two input strings and computes the
Hamming distance between the two strings. The Hamming distance is the number of bit positions
where the two strings differ. For example, the ASCII representations of the strings “foo” and “bar”
in binary are:
“foo” = 0110 0110 0110 1111 0110 1111
“bar” = 0110 0010 0110 0001 0111 0010
So, the Hamming distance between “foo” and “bar” is 8. • If the user enters two strings with different lengths, your program should return the Hamming
distance up to the length of the shorter string. • The maximum length of the string could be 255 characters. • The Hamming distance between the following two strings is 38:
this is a test
of the emergency broadcast • You must also make your own test cases. We will test it with ours!
Turning in your program
Submit the code files and report in a zip file and name it ‘project1_[your_id].zip’. For
example, if your ID is YL80856; the file name will be: ‘project1_YL80856.zip’. Submit it
in Blackboard Lab Assignments Tab. In your report following must be included:
1. Concept: Brief description of the algorithm implemented, why this approach is optimal,
how you came up with the approach
2. Code: Copy paste your assembly code in the report
3. Output: Screenshot the output cases
Make sure your report is in .pdf format and accessible
